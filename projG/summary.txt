441 Project G - Pre-Defined

I succesfully completed the bezier and convolutional neural net projects.

I partially completed the CUDA project (correct greyscale output, but not outputting sobel), I did however put a lot of work into the sobel filter, and I believe successfully figured out its block / thread dimensions if that counts for any credit.
